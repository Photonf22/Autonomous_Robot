# Autonomous_Robot
This is my repository of current work on building an autonomous robot that will be able to navigate indoor terrain and in the future outdoor. This is my own personal workspace where I save all my current work. Current development is being done in WSL2 using NVIDIA CUDA and Basler Pylon libraries along with opencv. In the future development will move into a Jetson Nano.
